        <header><b>Happy's</b> one day at home.</header>
        <p>
            Me and my husband Rex bought Happy when he was just 2 month old. On his first day at home he slept for so long.
            He was scared so much with new enviroment,but with so much love he became comfortable.Happy loves playing with
            toothpaste covers,bottle covers and something that not actually cat toy things.
        </p>
        <p>
            Me and my husband were thingking why we didnt buy before,but maybe we were waiting Happy to be born. He is 
            part of our family.He just like our small child. He has own vet, we visit sometimes her to get vaccinated or 
            dewormed. Every two weeks we cut Happy nails and once in a moth we shower him.
            <p>
                Even though he always runs at home, drops something from the table we still love him so much. By the way,
                he has girlfriend. Her name is Bella. She lives in our previous place, villa 11.When we went for vacation, he 
                stayed with her and enjoyed playing.
                Happy doesnt like:
                <li>
                    To be disturbed when sleeping
                    <li>Too much hugs</li>
                    <li>Take a bath</li>
                </li>
